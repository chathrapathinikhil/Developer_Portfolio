        "At CSU Fullerton, I pursued my masterâ€™s in computer science. My focus was on advanced topics like algorithms, databases, and machine learning, but what stood out most was the hands-on work. I built projects involving web applications, cloud services, and even AI/LLM workflows. Working in teams was a big part of the program, and it gave me the chance to practice taking ideas from design through to deployment.",

      description:
        "For my undergraduate studies, I majored in electronics and communication engineering. While the program was rooted in hardware and communications, I gravitated toward programming and software projects. This is where I built my foundation in coding and problem-solving, picking up C and Java as my first serious programming languages. Being in a technical environment helped me transition smoothly into software engineering as a career.",
