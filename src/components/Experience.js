In addition to web development, I supported day-to-day technology needs, improved online resources, and helped streamline internal processes.

        "At WhiteHat Jr, I was part of the team building the platform that delivers online coding lessons to students. Most of my work was split between the frontend and backend. On the frontend side, I helped build interactive learning modules and made sure the UI ran smoothly without glitches or delays. On the backend side, I worked on things like payment systems, login flows, and keeping everything secure. I also spent a lot of time fixing performance issues and preventing bugs from slipping into production. Whenever there were repetitive tasks that slowed the team down, I wrote scripts to automate them so we could focus on actual development.",

        "At Jaguar Land Rover, I contributed to the infotainment systems used in their vehicles. My role involved developing features for the in-car display â€” everything from the way the screens looked to how the system responded when drivers interacted with it. I also worked on the backend logic that kept the UI updated in real time with what the car was doing. Beyond development, I helped set up automated pipelines so new versions could be tested and released with fewer errors. A big part of the job was also making sure the system was stable, testing it thoroughly, and fixing issues before they reached customers.",
